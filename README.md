# button
Library for working with buttons on the MSP430.
Example code included in `example.c`.

## General Notes
Assumes buttons are active low.  Configures with internal pull-up resistor if button open state is floating.

## Functions
- `void configureP1PinAsButton(char pin)`
    - Configures pin as input with internal pull-up resistor
    - Pin settings
        - P1DIR = 0 (input)
        - P1REN = 1 (enable internal pull-up/pull-down networks)
        - P1OUT = 1 (configure as pull-up)
    - Usage:
        - `configureP1PinAsButton(BIT3);`
            - Configures Port 1, Pin 3 as button
        - `configureP1PinAsButton(BIT0|BIT1|BIT2);`
            - Configures Port 1, Pins 0, 1, and 2 as button
- `char isP1ButtonReleased(char pin)`
    - Returns one if pin is high, zero if pin is low
    - Usage:
        - `isP1ButtonReleased(BIT3);`
            - Returns 1 if released
            - Returns 0 if pressed
- `void waitForP1ButtonRelease(char pin)`
    - Blocks until detects pin going high
    - Debounces after detection
    - Usage:
        - `waitForP1ButtonRelease(BIT3);`
            - Blocks until pin 3 is high, debounces
- `char isP1ButtonPressed(char pin)`
    - Returns one if pin is low, zero if pin is high.
    - Usage:
        - `isP1ButtonPressed(BIT3);`
            - Returns 1 if pressed
            - Returns 0 if released
- `char pollP1Buttons(char buttonsToPoll[], char numberOfButtonsToPoll)`
    - Blocks until button is pushed, returns bit mask of pressed button
    - Usage:
        - Blocks until one of buttons is pushed
        - `pressedButton` is set to mask of pushed button

```
char buttons[] = {BIT1, BIT2, BIT3};
char pressedButton = pollP1Buttons(buttons, 3);
```
- `char checkP1Buttons(char buttonsToCheck[], char numberOfButtonsToCheck);`
	- Checks set of buttons for press, returns bit mask of pressed button
	- Do this if you don't want to block
- `void debounce()`
    - Delays for 1000 clock cycles.
    - Time length depends on clock speed, but 1ms with 1MHz clock.
    - Usage:
        - `debounce();`
